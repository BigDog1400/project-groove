## Milestone 9: Deployment Preparation

**Objective:** Prepare the application for deployment to the app stores.

**Technical Context:**

* This involves configuring app icons, splash screens, and other deployment-related settings.

**Requirements:**

1. **Create app icons and splash screens in the required sizes and formats for both Android and iOS.**
2. **Configure app.json/app.config.js with the necessary metadata (app name, version, description, etc.).**
3. **Prepare build scripts for Android and iOS using Expo's build tools.** (eas build)
4. **(Optional) Set up automatic build and deployment pipelines (e.g., with EAS Update).**

**Instructions for LLM:**

* Generate configuration files (`app.json` or `app.config.js`) with placeholder metadata.
* Provide instructions or scripts for building the app using Expo's build tools, including necessary parameters.

This comprehensive breakdown into separate milestone files, each containing explicit instructions and context, makes it easier for an LLM to execute the project step by step, generating code and configurations as needed. The `.md` files serve as self-contained units of work, making the project management and automation significantly smoother. Remember,  LLMs can have difficulty directly interacting with external systems (like Supabase). These instructions would primarily serve to generate code, scripts, and configurations that a developer would then execute. Adapting these steps for direct LLM control would require further refinement to overcome those interaction limitations.
