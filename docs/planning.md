**Product Owner Perspective: Envisioning the "Grease the Groove" Companion App**

**Vision:**  To create a simple yet powerful mobile application that empowers users to effectively implement the Grease the Groove training method, maximizing their strength gains through consistent, submaximal practice. The app should remove the guesswork, provide structure, and facilitate adherence to GtG principles.

**Core Principles Guiding Product Development:**

* **Simplicity:**  The app should be extremely easy to use, requiring minimal effort from the user to log workouts. The focus is on quick interaction and seamless integration into daily life.
* **Consistency:** The app should encourage and facilitate daily practice, a key tenet of GtG.
* **Flexibility:**  While providing structure, the app should allow users to customize their GtG plan based on their chosen exercises and personal schedules.
* **Progress Tracking (Simplified):** Track the core elements of GtG success without overwhelming the user with complex data.

**Product Features & User Experience:**

* **Exercise Selection:** Users can choose 1-3 core exercises (pull-ups, push-ups, squats, dips, etc.) for their GtG routine.
* **Rep Target Setting:**  Users define their target number of reps per set. The app emphasizes the importance of staying well below maximum capacity. Guided advice will be offered based on initial user input regarding maximum reps.
* **Reminder & Notification System:**
    * **Regular Reminders:** Users can set reminders at specific intervals throughout the day to perform their sets.
    * **Smart Reminders:** The app can intelligently suggest set times based on the user's typical schedule and activity patterns (optional premium feature).
* **Effortless Set Logging:**  A single tap or swipe is sufficient to log a completed set.
* **Focus on Quality, Not Quantity (UI/UX):** The app should visually emphasize performing perfect reps rather than focusing on total volume.
* **Progress Dashboard:** Simple visual representation of daily consistency:
    * **Streak Tracker:** Consecutive days of completing all planned sets.
    * **Completion Percentage:** Daily progress towards completing all planned sets for each chosen exercise.
    * **Basic History (Optional):** Calendar or list view of completed days.
* **Educational Content:**  Concise and clear explanation of the Grease the Groove method, including tips for maximizing effectiveness.
* **Minimalist Design:** Clean interface, easy-to-read fonts, no distractions. The focus should be on the task at hand: logging sets and staying consistent.
* **Optional Gamification (Premium Feature):**  Introduce badges or achievements for maintaining streaks or reaching milestones.

**Software Engineer Perspective: Defining Technical Requirements and Development Milestones**

**Technical Foundations:**

* **Expo for Cross-Platform Development:**  Utilize Expo to create a single codebase deployable to both Android and iOS, accelerating development and simplifying maintenance.
* **Supabase as Backend:**  Leverage Supabase for user authentication, database storage, and potentially Realtime updates for synchronized data across devices.
* **TypeScript:**  Ensure code quality, maintainability, and type safety through TypeScript.
* **State Management:** Implement a lightweight state management solution (e.g., Zustand) to handle exercise selections, set targets, reminders, and user progress data efficiently.

**Detailed Technical Requirements:**

* **Authentication (Supabase Auth):**
    * Email/Password authentication.
    * Social logins (optional).
* **Database Structure (Supabase):**
    * **Users Table:** Stores user information (ID, email, preferences).
    * **Exercises Table:**  Stores predefined exercises (name, description).
    * **UserExercises Table:** Links users to their chosen GtG exercises, stores target reps per set.
    * **Sets Table:** Stores timestamps of completed sets, linking to UserExercises and including relevant details (number of reps).
* **API Endpoints (Supabase Functions/Edge Functions):**
    * **Create/Retrieve/Update User Preferences:** Handling exercise selections and rep targets.
    * **Log Completed Sets:**  Adding new set entries to the Sets table.
    * **Retrieve User Progress Data:**  For generating dashboard visualizations.
* **Notification System:**
    * **Local Notifications (Expo Notifications):**  For reminders at scheduled intervals.
    * **Push Notifications (Optional, potentially for future social features):** If necessary, using Expo Push Notifications or integrating with a dedicated push notification service.
* **UI Components:**  Develop reusable UI components for consistent design and efficient development, such as:
    * **Exercise Cards:**  For displaying exercise selections.
    * **Set Logging Button:**  For easy set recording.
    * **Progress Bar:** To visualize daily progress toward completing all sets.

**Project Milestones & Deliverables:**

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup & Planning**

* **Deliverables:**
    * Finalized Product Requirements Document.
    * Detailed design mockups (wireframes or high-fidelity).
    * Supabase project setup (database schema, authentication configured).
    * Expo project initialized with basic navigation structure.

**Phase 2: Core Functionality - Exercise Selection & Set Logging**

* **Deliverables:**
    * Screens for selecting GtG exercises and setting rep targets (stored in Supabase).
    * Functionality to log completed sets (persisted in Supabase).
    * Basic UI for the Home screen displaying chosen exercises.
    * API endpoints for exercise management and set logging.

**Phase 3: Reminder System & Progress Dashboard**

* **Deliverables:**
    * Implementation of local notifications based on user-defined intervals.
    * Simple dashboard screen showing streak and completion percentage.
    * API endpoints to retrieve progress data.

**Phase 4: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment**

* **Deliverables:**
    * Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, UI).
    * Code refactoring and optimization.
    * Deployment to app stores (Android and iOS) using Expo's build and submission tools.

**Future Enhancements (Consider for Post-MVP Roadmap):**

* **Smart Reminder System:**  Analyze user patterns to suggest optimal set times.
* **Apple Watch/Wear OS Integration:**  For easier set logging directly from a smartwatch.
* **Social Features:**  Share progress with friends, create friendly competitions (potentially using push notifications for interaction).
* **Advanced Analytics:**  Provide more detailed insights into training progress and patterns.
* **Export/Import Data:**  Allow users to export their data and import it into other tools or platforms.

**Conclusion:**

By prioritizing simplicity, consistency, and a focus on the core principles of Grease the Groove, this app has the potential to be a valuable tool for users seeking to improve their strength through regular, submaximal practice. The technical approach utilizes modern tools and frameworks (Expo, Supabase, TypeScript) for efficient and maintainable development. By clearly defining milestones and deliverables, the development process can be well-managed and delivered in a timely manner.
